                            <p>About the artists: </p>
                            <p>Tomorrow‚Äôs New Quartet is a project that was formed last year amidst the various lockdowns and restrictions that were put in place to combat the pandemic. It plays the original music of Amsterdam-based drummer/ composer Rod Oughton, who wrote of this music during that challenging time. Oughton used composition to stay creative and optimistic during the lockdowns, and the band‚Äôs name is a reflection of that.</p>
                            <p>The band‚Äôs stellar line up consists of some of the UK‚Äôs fastest rising Jazz stars. This includes Scottish saxophonist Helena Kay, electric bass extraordinaire Flo Moore and BBC Young Jazz Musician of the Year Deschanel Gordon on keys. The band‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄúAll Together, Now!‚Äù Is being released on the Ubuntu Music label in May 2022.</p>

                            <p>The DGR is coming to Cambridge this May and Hot Numbers Coffee are delighted to be hosting this fundraising event once again at the Roastery. Last year we had a brilliant collection of riders &#8211; women, men, young and old! Everyone gathered, took a look at the amazing motorbikes dotted around the car park and chatted about life over a coffee and a bacon roll (veggie options were available too!). After the meet, the riders set off together on their pre-planned route through the beautiful countryside. We&#8217;re looking to recreate a similar feel this year, so if you ride a classic motorbike or are interested in seeing what all the fuss is about and just coming along to take a look, check out the link below: </p>
