<h2>Delivery cost &amp; delivery area</h2>
<p>Prices stated on our website include delivery charge within the U.K.</p>

<h2>Delivery time</h2>
<p>We guarantee to deliver all orders within 7 days of order. If we are unable to deliver within 7 days we will only proceed with an order after your agreement to a longer time.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Delivery address</h2>
<p>We are happy to deliver to any address that you specify within our delivery area. We will deliver to an alternative address for you or equally to the address of another person. Please note that as your order is electronically transmitted to us as soon as the order is confirmed, we are unable to change the delivery address. Therefore please check that the details are correct at the time of placing your order. The delivery address should be a full address including postcode. Just a house name or number is insufficient.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Chosen delivery partners</h2>
<p>All products will be delivered using the Royal Mail or Parcel Force first class postal service. Alternatively we may use a courier to deliver products.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Direct dispatch</h2>
<p>Certain products are dispatched direct to you from the manufacturer, rather than coming to our warehouse and being sent to you from there. When this is the case we will highlight the number of days you will expect to wait for your delivery.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Risk and ownership</h2>
<p>Risk of damage to or loss of the Goods passes to you at the time of delivery to you (or to the agreed shipping address), or, if you fail to take delivery at the agreed time, when we tried to deliver. You will only own the Goods once they have been successfully delivered and when we have received cleared payment in full.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Payment problems</h2>
<p>Delays in delivery will occur if inaccurate payment details are given, so please ensure that the card and other payment details given are all correct. We may suspend or cancel a delivery if full payment is not available when your order is made.</p>

<h2>Liability</h2>
<p>We will not be liable for any loss caused to you by late delivery of our products. We will not be liable for any loss or damage to Goods once they have been delivered in accordance with your delivery instructions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>We are sure you will be happy with your order but if you are not happy you can return any item, to receive a full refund goods must be returned unused within 14 days of receipt of goods.</p>
<hr />
<h2>General</h2>
<p>All items must be returned to us before a refund or replacement is issued. If we have made a mistake weâ€™ll also refund the delivery charge. We will notify you as soon as your refund/replacement has been issued to you, this will be within 7 days of us receiving the goods back from you. This does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.</p>
